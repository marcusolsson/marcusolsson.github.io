While you can limit the data requested in each query, one of the best ways to reduce the loading time is to reduce the number of requests being made to the data source.</description></item><item><title>Beginner-friendly issues</title><link>https://marcus.se.net/beginner-friendly-issues/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.se.net/beginner-friendly-issues/</guid><description>One of the first pieces of advice that aspiring contributors get when looking to contribute to their first open source project is to search for “beginner-friendly issues”.

Since I knew some React from previous projects, I wrote my first Grafana plugin that would adapt the original Carpet plot to the new plugin platform. I’ve called it Hourly heatmap, and in this blog post, I’d like to quickly introduce what it does and how it can be helpful.</description></item><item><title>Learn Grafana: How to automatically repeat rows and panels in dynamic dashboards</title><link>https://marcus.se.net/repeat-rows-and-panels/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.se.net/repeat-rows-and-panels/</guid><description>Running your software on dynamic infrastructure means that your monitoring platform needs to change dynamically. Variables let you reuse a single dashboard for all your services. Select the service you want to inspect from a drop-down menu, and watch panels update to only show you metrics from that service. A common use case for variables is to filter data within a panel. In this blog post, we’ll look at how you can dynamically add and remove entire panels through a feature called repeated panels.</description></item><item><title>WFH tips: Slack hacks that will make you more productive</title><link>https://marcus.se.net/slack-hacks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.se.net/slack-hacks/</guid><description>As the work-from-home culture continues to reshape many people’s lives, the team at Grafana Labs has been sharing tips, tricks, and hacks we have learned as a remote-first company.

If you try to answer too many questions in a single dashboard, it can become overly complex. As a consequence, a single dashboard often can’t tell the whole story. So you end up navigating between several, and it can be quite inefficient to search for a particular dashboard every time you need it. Luckily, there are some hacks for navigating between dashboards.</description></item><item><title>Adding context and options to your Go client package</title><link>https://marcus.se.net/adding-context-and-options-to-your-go-client-package/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Mar 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.se.net/adding-context-and-options-to-your-go-client-package/</guid><description>This is a follow-up on my previous post where I showed how you can write user-friendly client packages for REST APIs that will make it even more enjoyable for users to integrate with your services. And for many services, the patterns I showed will probably suffice. This time though, we’ll take a look at two additional patterns. First, I’ll show you how you can bring your client package up-to-date by adding support for the context package.</description></item><item><title>Notes on my GolangUK 2016 talk</title><link>https://marcus.se.net/gouk16-notes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Aug 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.se.net/gouk16-notes/</guid><description>I’m writing this on the way home from GolangUK where I did a talk on Building an Enterprise Service in Go, based on the DDD Sample App. I was really overwhelmed with the positive feedback I got, some of which came from developers who never heard of DDD prior to my talk. Not totally unexpected however, since it’s an approach to a problem space which I believe Go has yet to conquer, but among the feedback I got were a few valid concerns that I thought I would address in the form of a blog post.</description></item><item><title>Domain Driven Design in Go: Part 3</title><link>https://marcus.se.net/go-ddd-part-3/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Mar 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.se.net/go-ddd-part-3/</guid><description>Up until now, we have only looked at one service in isolation, but this is seldom the case in a service-oriented architecture. For the last post in this blog series on Domain Driven Design in Go we will have a look at how we interact with other services. In particular, we will have a look at two concepts that help us reason about these interactions: application services and bounded contexts.</description></item><item><title>Writing a Go client for your RESTful API</title><link>https://marcus.se.net/writing-a-client-package/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Feb 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.se.net/writing-a-client-package/</guid><description>By providing your users with a client SDK in their favorite language you are making it even easier to integrate their services with yours.

The purpose was to showcase the concepts from DDD in a real-world application. Since then, the application has been ported to other languages such as C# and Ruby. Of course, as a DDD practitioner and a Go developer I thought it might be a fun exercise to try porting it to Go.</description></item><item><title>Events and explosions in a distributed system</title><link>https://marcus.se.net/events-and-explosions/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Jun 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marcus.se.net/events-and-explosions/</guid><description>I did a talk on Event Storming a short while ago where I started off by explaining why state transitions are so much more interesting than the actual states themselves.
