  - title: Building your first panel plugin
    type: Talk
    description: |
      Plugins amplify what you can do with Grafana. By creating your own custom visualizations and data source integrations you can bring in your own data and present it in a way that makes sense for you.

      In this webinar, Solutions Engineer Christine Wang and Developer Advocate Marcus Olsson will show you how you can build a panel plugin to create custom visualizations for Grafana.

  - title: Running Chaos Engineering experiments with Gremlin and Grafana
    type: Talk
    description: Complex systems fail in complex and unexpected ways. Monitoring is critical to detect and resolve those incidents when they happen. But how do you know your monitoring and alerting are working correctly? Chaos Engineering allows you to validate your monitoring, test your systems with controlled failure, and practice your incident response processes. In this session, we’ll cover how to set up Grafana to quickly identify potential threats and how to get started with Chaos Engineering with Gremlin.

    type: Talk
    description: Your open source project has growing, improving, and amassing new features. The README is getting unwieldy, and you decide that it's about time that your baby gets some proper documentation. But how do you document a non-trivial open source project? How do you make sure that your docs are consistent, even with several authors around the world, many who don't have English as their native language? Marcus shares some of his experiences from the Grafana project.

  - title: Building an enterprise service in Go
    type: Talk
    slides: https://speakerdeck.com/marcusolsson/building-an-enterprise-service-in-go
    description: Go has been widely successful for creating tools and infrastructure, but the simplicity of the language also makes for an excellent fit for implementing core business applications. We will look at a few patterns for domain objects and code organization and hopefully we'll take some additional steps towards Go in the modern enterprise. During this talk we will look at a sample application that demonstrates how a core domain could be implemented in Go. Hopefully, it will serve as leverage and inspiration for developers that want to write their next enterprise service in Go rather than using the traditional Java stack.
