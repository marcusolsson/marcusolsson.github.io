Not only does this allow them to create their own custom visualizations and data source integrations—taking the Grafana experience to the next-level—but by sharing them with the community, they’re able to help others do the same.</p></div></article><article class="card mb-8"><div class=card__body><header class=text-center><time datetime=2020-06-24 class="text-sm text--disabled mb-4">Jun 24, 2020</time><h2><a href=https://grafana.com/blog/2020/06/24/learn-grafana-how-to-build-a-scatter-plot-plugin-in-grafana-7.0/>Learn Grafana: How to build a scatter plot plugin in Grafana 7.0</a></h2></header><p>There are a lot of great things about Grafana 7.0, but one of my favorite features is the new React-based plugin platform, which has a set of new APIs and design system to help you build your own plugin.

Since I knew some React from previous projects, I wrote my first Grafana plugin that would adapt the original Carpet plot to the new plugin platform.

Variables let you reuse a single dashboard for all your services. Select the service you want to inspect from a drop-down menu, and watch panels update to only show you metrics from that service. A common use case for variables is to filter data within a panel. In this blog post, we’ll look at how you can dynamically add and remove entire panels through a feature called repeated panels.</p></div></article><article class="card mb-8"><div class=card__body><header class=text-center><time datetime=2020-04-27 class="text-sm text--disabled mb-4">Apr 27, 2020</time><h2><a href=https://grafana.com/blog/2020/04/27/wfh-tips-slack-hacks-that-will-make-you-more-productive/>WFH tips: Slack hacks that will make you more productive</a></h2></header><p>As the work-from-home culture continues to reshape many people’s lives, the team at Grafana Labs has been sharing tips, tricks, and hacks we have learned as a remote-first company. One tool that has been vital to our internal communications and team building is Slack.

If you try to answer too many questions in a single dashboard, it can become overly complex. As a consequence, a single dashboard often can’t tell the whole story. So you end up navigating between several, and it can be quite inefficient to search for a particular dashboard every time you need it. Luckily, there are some hacks for navigating between dashboards.</p></div></article><article class="card mb-8"><div class=card__body><header class=text-center><time datetime=2017-03-21 class="text-sm text--disabled mb-4">Mar 21, 2017</time><h2><a href=https://medium.com/@marcus.olsson/adding-context-and-options-to-your-go-client-package-244c4ad1231b>Adding context and options to your Go client package</a></h2></header><p>This is a follow-up on my previous post where I showed how you can write user-friendly client packages for REST APIs that will make it even more enjoyable for users to integrate with your services.
