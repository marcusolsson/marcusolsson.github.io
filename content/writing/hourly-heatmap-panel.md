Grafana 7.0 introduced a brand new React-based platform, along with a set of improved APIs for building plugins. Since I knew some React from previous projects, I wrote my first Grafana plugin that would adapt the original Carpet plot to the new plugin platform. I’ve called it Hourly heatmap, and in this blog post, I’d like to quickly introduce what it does and how it can be helpful.
