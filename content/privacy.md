## Hosting

The website is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and is hosted using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). You can see the source code in the [GitHub project page](https://github.com/marcusolsson/marcusolsson.github.io).

## Analytics

I use analytics for this website and the documentation sites for my projects. I use [Plausible](https://plausible.io), which is an open source and privacy-friendly analytics service. To see what I see, [check out the metrics for yourself](https://plausible.io/marcus.se.net).

## Monitoring

I use [https://updown.io](https://updown.io) to monitor uptime and latency for the website. You can see it for yourself at the [public status page](https://status.marcus.se.net).
