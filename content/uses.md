title: What I'm using right now
---

This page lists the tools, apps, and services that I use.

> I got inspired to write this after seeing [Kent C. Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com)' list of [tools he uses](https://kentcdodds.com/uses).

## Desktop apps

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Enough](https://github.com/marcusolsson/vscode-theme-enough) editor theme.
- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox), but I use [Brave](https://brave.com/) for anything that needs [Blink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blink_(browser_engine)).
- [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) has replaced [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) for me.
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
- [Slack](https://slack.com/)
- [Discord](https://discord.com/)
- [1Password](https://1password.com/)
- [Mullvad VPN](https://mullvad.net/)
- [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com)
- [Signal](https://signal.org)
- [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com) — An excellent (and cheap!) alternative to Adobe Illustrator.
- [Camtasia](https://www.techsmith.com/video-editor.html) for screen recording and video productions.
- [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) for when I need to record my voice.
- [Pixelmator Pro](https://www.pixelmator.com/pro/) — For everyday image editing. I mostly use Affinity Designer most of the time though.
- [Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical) — Trying it out for a year. So far I'm not sure how it's any better than the macOS Calendar app.
- [CleanShot X](https://cleanshot.com/)
- [Little Snitch](https://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch)
- [Zoom](https://zoom.us/)

## Services

- [Fastmail](https://www.fastmail.com), [HEY](https://www.hey.com/), [ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com/), and [GMail](https://mail.google.com) — My email is a mess. I love the HEY model, but it's a bit pricey and has no calendar support. Right now I'm evaluating Fastmail.
- [Tresorit](https://tresorit.com/) — End-to-end encrypted cloud storage with a decent mobile app. Only downside is the price.
- [You Need A Budget](https://youneedabudget.com) — Wish I found this when I got my first job. Now I know where my money goes.
- [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/) — Probably the biggest contributor to my mental health.
- [Buy Me A Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com) — For projects I'm working on outside my day-job. Honestly, it's more for managing my imposter syndrome than to generate income.
- [LanguageTool](https://languagetool.org/) — Not quite as good as Grammarly, but I prefer their privacy policy.
- [Pocket](https://getpocket.com) — Not a fan, but better than any of the alternatives.

- [Grovemade Wool Felt Desk Pad](https://grovemade.com/product/wool-felt-desk-pad/) — Looks good, but also keeps the Moonlander in place as it does tend to slide away from me otherwise.
- [twelve south Curve](https://www.twelvesouth.com/products/curve-for-macbook) — Elevates my MacBook from my desk.
- [Dell UltraSharp U2718Q 27"](https://www.dell.com/en-si/work/shop/cty/pdp/spd/dell-u2718q-monitor) — I use this as my primary display with the MacBook on the side.

- [Sigma 30mm f/1,4 DC DN](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01C3SCKI6) — Bought this lens with the camera, but I'm not quite happy with the field of view. Looking at the 16mm version.
