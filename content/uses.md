title: What I'm using right now
---

This page lists the tools, apps, and services that I use. I got inspired to write this after seeing [Kent C. Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com)' list of [tools he uses](https://kentcdodds.com/uses).

Here's what each of the labels mean:

- ❤️ Can't imagine using anything else.
- 👍 Does the job well. No plans on switching.
- 🤷‍♂️ Would prefer to find a better alternative.

## Desktop apps

- ❤️ [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Enough](https://github.com/marcusolsson/vscode-theme-enough) editor theme.
- ❤️ [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) has replaced [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) for me.
- ❤️ [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
- ❤️ ️️[1Password](https://1password.com/)
- ❤️ [Mullvad VPN](https://mullvad.net/)

- 👍 [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox), but I use [Brave](https://brave.com/) for anything that needs [Blink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blink_(browser_engine)).
- 👍 [Camtasia](https://www.techsmith.com/video-editor.html) for screen recording and video productions.

- 👍 [Little Snitch](https://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch)
- 👍 [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com)
- 🤷‍♂️ [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) for when I need to record my voice.
