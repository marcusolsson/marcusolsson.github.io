I'm an imaginative generalist who uses his experience of building software products to create educational resources for other developers. I find my passion in making sense of complex topics and then teaching what I've learned to others.

Here are some of the things I can do for you:

- **Developer documentation**: Designing and writing [developer docs](https://marcus.se.net/obsidian-plugin-docs), [guides](/forum-series-plugin-development), and [blog posts](/writing).
- **Developer support**: Supporting developers when official resources aren't enough, for example on forums, office hours, or organized events.
- **Developer tools**: Building tooling to automate workflows and to simplify the life for developers and documentarians, such as [linters](https://github.com/grafana/plugin-validator), [generators](https://github.com/marcusolsson/json-schema-docs), or scripts.
- **Examples and prototypes**: Building examples or [prototypes](/projects) that demonstrates the use of an API, or other technologies, to show others what's possible.
- **Public speaking** Facilitating remote or in-person [training workshops or presentations](/speaking).
